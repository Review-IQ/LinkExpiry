# Quick Password Test - 2 Minutes

## The Problem

You're testing: `https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN/password`

❌ **This is WRONG!** This is like trying to visit a "submit button" URL. It doesn't work that way.

## The Solution (Takes 30 seconds)

### Step 1: Visit the Frontend URL
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN
```

**NOT the backend URL! Use the FRONTEND URL!**

### Step 2: You'll See a Password Form

You should see a nice UI with:
- A lock icon
- "Password Protected" heading
- A password input field
- "Access Link" button

### Step 3: Enter the Password

Enter whatever password you used when creating the link.

If you don't remember, create a NEW link with a simple password like `test123`.

### Step 4: Click "Access Link"

If the password is correct → You'll be redirected to the original URL

If the password is wrong → You'll see "Invalid password. Please try again."

## Visual Guide

```
Browser Address Bar:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN       │  ← Frontend URL (CORRECT!)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

What You'll See:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔒  Password Protected             │
│  This link requires a password      │
│                                     │
│  Password: [___________]            │
│                                     │
│  [Access Link]  [Cancel]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## If You Still See "Invalid Password"

1. **Make sure you're using the FRONTEND URL**: `http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN`
2. **NOT the backend URL**: `https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN`

3. **Create a fresh test link**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/dashboard
   - Click "Create New Link"
   - URL: https://google.com
   - Password: `test123` (simple and easy to remember!)
   - Create the link
   - Note the short code
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5173/{YOUR_SHORT_CODE}`
   - Enter password: `test123`

4. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab) for any errors

5. **Check Network tab** (F12 → Network tab):
   - Should see: HEAD request → 401
   - Then when you submit: POST request → 302 (if correct password)

## Why Your Way Doesn't Work

```
❌ What you're doing:
https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN/password

This is like trying to visit a form submission URL directly.
It's a POST endpoint, not a page!
```

```
✅ What you should do:
http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN

This shows you the password form.
When you submit, the FRONTEND posts to the backend.
```

## The Correct Flow

```
1. You visit: http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN
   ↓
2. Frontend checks status: HEAD https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN
   ↓
3. Backend responds: 401 (Password Required)
   ↓
4. Frontend shows you: Password Form
   ↓
5. You enter password and click submit
   ↓
6. Frontend sends: POST https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN/password
   ↓
7. Backend verifies password
   ↓
8. If correct: 302 Redirect → Original URL
   If wrong: 401 Error → "Invalid password"
```

**TL;DR**: Visit `http://localhost:5173/axK2LTN` NOT `https://localhost:34049/axK2LTN/password`
