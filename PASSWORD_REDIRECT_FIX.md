# Password-Protected Link Redirect Fix

## Problem

Password-protected links were "redirecting to the backend URL" instead of the final destination URL.

### What Was Happening:

```
1. User visits: http://localhost:5173/Pzc5Glu
2. Frontend shows password form
3. User enters password
4. Frontend POSTs to backend
5. Backend stores password in session, returns 302
6. Frontend redirects to: https://localhost:34049/Pzc5Glu
7. Backend GET request checks session for password
8. ❌ SESSION COOKIE NOT SENT (cross-origin issue!)
9. Backend returns 401 or shows JSON instead of redirecting
10. User sees backend URL in browser instead of final destination
```

## Root Cause

**Session cookies weren't being sent cross-origin** from frontend (`http://localhost:5173`) to backend (`https://localhost:34049`).

The session cookie configuration was missing:
- `SameSite = SameSiteMode.None` - Required for cross-origin cookies
- `SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always` - Required for HTTPS

Without these settings, when the frontend redirected to the backend after password submission, the session cookie wasn't included, so the backend couldn't find the stored password.

## Solution

### ✅ Fix Applied to Backend

**File**: `backend/LinkExpiry.API/Program.cs` (lines 116-123)

**Before**:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
});
```

**After**:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None; // Allow cross-origin requests
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always; // Require HTTPS
});
```

### What This Does:

- **`SameSite = SameSiteMode.None`**: Allows the cookie to be sent in cross-origin requests (from `http://localhost:5173` to `https://localhost:34049`)
- **`SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always`**: Requires HTTPS for the cookie (security requirement when using SameSite=None)

## How It Works Now

### Correct Flow for Password-Protected Links:

```
1. User visits: http://localhost:5173/Pzc5Glu
   ↓
2. Frontend: HEAD request → Backend returns 401 (password required)
   ↓
3. Frontend: Shows password form
   ↓
4. User enters password and submits
   ↓
5. Frontend: POST to /Pzc5Glu/password with password
   ↓
6. Backend: Verifies password with BCrypt
   ↓
7. Backend: Stores password in session with SameSite=None cookie
   ↓
8. Backend: Returns 302 redirect
   ↓
9. Frontend: Detects 302, redirects to https://localhost:34049/Pzc5Glu
   ↓
10. Browser: Sends GET request WITH session cookie (now works!)
   ↓
11. Backend: Finds password in session, verifies it
   ↓
12. Backend: Increments view count
   ↓
13. Backend: Returns 302 redirect to original URL (e.g., https://google.com)
   ↓
14. Browser: Navigates to final destination
   ↓
15. ✅ User sees https://google.com in address bar
```

## Testing

### Step 1: Restart Backend

**IMPORTANT**: You must restart the backend for the session cookie changes to take effect!

```bash
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)
cd C:\myStuff\LinkExpiry\backend\LinkExpiry.API
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Restart Frontend

Frontend has also been rebuilt with updated logging:

```bash
# Stop current frontend (Ctrl+C if running)
cd C:\myStuff\LinkExpiry\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Password-Protected Link

1. **Open NEW incognito window** (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Console and Network tabs
3. Visit: `http://localhost:5173/Pzc5Glu` (or your password-protected link)
4. Enter the password
5. Click "Access Link"

### Expected Result:

- You should see the password form
- After entering correct password, you should be redirected to the final destination URL (e.g., https://google.com)
- The address bar should show the final URL, NOT `https://localhost:34049/...`

### Check Browser Console:

You should see logs like:
```
[Password Submit] Starting submission...
[Password Submit] Password length: 6
[Password Submit] Trimmed password length: 6
[Password Submit] FormData created, posting to: https://localhost:34049/Pzc5Glu/password
[Password Submit] Response status: 302
[Password Submit] Response type: opaqueredirect
[Password Submit] Password accepted, redirecting to backend...
```

### Check Backend Logs:

You should see:
```
info: Password submission for Pzc5Glu, password length: 6
dbug: Hash from DB length: 60, starts with: $2a$11$...
info: Password verification result for Pzc5Glu: True
info: Password stored in session for Pzc5Glu
dbug: Redirecting Pzc5Glu to https://google.com
```

### Check Network Tab:

1. `POST /Pzc5Glu/password` → 302 (sets session cookie)
2. `GET /Pzc5Glu` → 302 (cookie sent, redirects to final URL)
3. `GET https://google.com` → 200 (final destination)

## Verification Checklist

After restarting both services:

- [ ] Backend restarted (session cookie config applied)
- [ ] Frontend restarted (updated code running)
- [ ] Testing in incognito window
- [ ] Password-protected link redirects to final URL
- [ ] Address bar shows final destination, NOT backend URL
- [ ] View count increments by 1

## Additional Changes

### Frontend Logging Added

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ShortLinkRedirect.tsx`

Added console logging to help debug:
- Password length and value
- Trimmed password length
- Response status and type
- Redirect confirmation

### Password Trimming

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ShortLinkRedirect.tsx` (line 93)

```typescript
const trimmedPassword = password.trim();
```

Prevents issues with accidental whitespace in passwords.

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Seeing Backend URL

**Cause**: Backend not restarted after fix

**Solution**: Stop backend (Ctrl+C) and run `dotnet run` again

### Issue 2: "Invalid Password" Even With Correct Password

**Cause**: Session cookie still not working, or wrong password

**Solution**:
1. Restart backend
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Test in fresh incognito window
4. Verify password is correct

### Issue 3: Cookies Not Being Set

**Check**: Browser DevTools → Application tab → Cookies → https://localhost:34049

Should see a session cookie with:
- SameSite: None
- Secure: Yes

## Files Modified

1. **backend/LinkExpiry.API/Program.cs** (lines 116-123)
   - Added `SameSite = SameSiteMode.None`
   - Added `SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always`

2. **frontend/src/pages/ShortLinkRedirect.tsx**
   - Added password trimming
   - Added detailed console logging
   - Updated comments

3. **frontend/dist** - Rebuilt with changes
